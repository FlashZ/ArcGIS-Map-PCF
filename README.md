# ArcGIS Map Component for PowerApps (PCF)

An easy-to-use custom PowerApps component that embeds interactive ArcGIS WebMaps into your applications using the PowerApps Component Framework.
This currently relies on User Authentication via a callback webresource, in the future I would like to get this working using true oauth or API keys rather than relying on the user signing in as it is intrusive UX when used in the model drive apps.
**Use this in a dev environment only, use at your own risk**

## Description

This PCF control provides seamless integration of ArcGIS WebMaps into PowerApps. It simplifies map embedding by handling ArcGIS authentication, enabling dynamic map loading, and supporting customizable widgetsâ€”all within PowerApps.

## Features

- **Integrated ArcGIS Authentication:** Easily configure OAuth authentication using your ArcGIS client ID.
- **Dynamic WebMap Loading:** Display specific WebMaps by setting the WebMap ID.
- **Lookup and Zoom:** Automatically search for features and zoom to particular map areas.
- **Customizable Widgets:** Supports built-in controls like LayerList, Home, and Zoom.
- **Logo and Styling Options:** Add a custom logo and configure visual aspects.
- **Flexible Projection Settings:** Set your desired spatial reference (default is WKID 4326).

## Configuration

### Required Parameters
- **clientId:** Your ArcGIS application client ID.
- **webMapId:** The ID of the ArcGIS WebMap to display.

### Optional Parameters
- **portalUrl:** (Default: `https://www.arcgis.com`) URL for alternative ArcGIS portals.
- **lookupLayerTitle / lookupFieldName / lookupFieldValue:** Parameters to enable feature lookup.
- **logoUrl:** URL for a custom logo.
- **projectionType:** Spatial reference WKID (default: `4326`).

## Usage

1. Add the control to your PowerApps app.
2. Configure properties in the properties panel:
   ```plaintext
   portalUrl: "https://www.arcgis.com"
   clientId: "<Your ArcGIS Client ID>"
   webMapId: "<Your WebMap ID>"
   ```
3. Save, publish, and test your app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues:** If authentication fails, verify your clientId and ensure your ArcGIS account has the appropriate permissions. See our [FAQ](#) for common fixes.
- **Display Problems:** Ensure that the WebMap ID is correct. Check network console for errors regarding map loading.
- **Environment Issues:** Tested with AGOL, currently doesn't support Enterprise.
